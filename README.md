## Deploying Bob

This gathers reference deployments for [Bob](https://bob-cd.github.io/) on various platforms. The cluster is configured as follows with a single replica setup of:
- [etcd](https://etcd.io)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [apiserver](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/tree/main/apiserver)
- [runner](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/tree/main/runner)
- [resource-git](https://github.com/bob-cd/resource-git)
- [artifact-store](https://github.com/bob-cd/artifact-local)

**Note: There are no resource limits configured and all defaults used. This is intended to be a reference for actual deployments.**
